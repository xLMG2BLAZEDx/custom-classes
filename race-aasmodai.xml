            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Aasmodai are the offspring of celestial and infernal bloodlines, embodying divine grace and infernal power in one form. With radiant eyes, shadowed wings, and skin that flickers between light and flame, they inspire awe and fear in equal measure. Most Aasmodai stand tall and proud, with glowing tattoos or markings representing their dual nature.</p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Aasmodai are rare and often solitary, not fitting into traditional celestial or fiendish orders. Many are driven by a desire to define their own purpose, often becoming warriors, scholars, or prophets. Their struggle to balance divine judgment and infernal passion defines their worldview.</p>
            <h4>AASMODAI TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Beings born of divine light and hellish flame, straddling both worlds.</p>
