            <h4>Half-Demon Template</h4>
            <p>When a mortal bloodline is tainted with the essence of a powerful demon—whether through a pact, inheritance, or infernal experimentation—the result may be a Half-Demon. Agile, powerful, and often wrestling with their inner nature, Half-Demons walk the line between destruction and redemption.</p>
