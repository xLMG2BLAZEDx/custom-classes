    <description>
      <p>In the shifting depths of the Ungeon, where reality is pliable and knowledge bleeds into power, a mysterious phenomenon changes those exposed to its ambient magic. Some Blood Hunters willingly submit themselves to this ambient arcane influence, their very blood transformed by forces beyond the veil of reality.</p>
      <p class="indent">The Order of the Arcane Blood embraces this metamorphosis, undergoing a ritual known as the Transfiguration. Their essence is irrevocably altered by Ungeonic magic. Unlike savage beasts, these hunters become vessels of raw arcana—exuding energy, casting strange light, and bending magical laws around them. Their powers manifest in radiant sigils, ephemeral appendages, and otherworldly force. But maintaining control over such chaotic energy takes an indomitable will, or the arcane torrent within may tear them—and those around them—apart.</p>

    <description>
      <p>At 3rd level, your attunement to the arcane signatures of the Ungeon grants you heightened perception. You gain advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks and Wisdom (Perception) checks related to sensing magic or magical creatures. You can also detect the presence of magical auras within 10 feet as if by the detect magic spell (no action required).</p>

  <element name="Arcane Metamorphosis" type="Archetype Feature" source="Ramsay's Homebrew" id="ID_RAMSAY_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_ARCANE_METAMORPHOSIS">
    <description>
      <p>Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to undergo an arcane transformation. As an action, you invoke the latent Ungeon magic within you, triggering a transformation that lasts for 10 minutes. This magical form manifests as glowing runes, ethereal limbs, or crystalline skin and changes with each transformation.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can use this feature twice, regaining all expended uses on a short or long rest. While transformed, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Arcane Channeling.</i></b> You add your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) to your melee damage rolls. Your unarmed strikes can deliver your crimson rite as if they were a weapon.
      </p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Spell-Touched Flesh.</i></b> While not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and resistance to force and radiant damage.
      </p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Echo Strikes.</i></b> When you take the Attack action with an unarmed strike, you can make a second unarmed strike as a bonus action. These strikes deal 1d6 force damage (1d8 at 11th level, 1d10 at 18th level).
      </p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Arcane Instability.</i></b> At the start of each of your turns, if you took damage since your last turn, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw (or half the damage taken, whichever is higher). On a failed save, uncontrolled energy erupts from you: every creature within 5 feet takes 1d6 force damage.

    <description>
      <p>At 7th level, your transformation grants you unnatural mobility. Your speed increases by 10 feet. You can also move through the space of creatures one size larger than you without expending extra movement.</p>
      <p class="indent">Additionally, when in your transformed state, your Echo Strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical damage.</p>

  <element name="Arcane Evolution" type="Archetype Feature" source="Ramsay's Homebrew" id="ID_RAMSAY_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_ARCANE_EVOLUTION">
    <description>
      <p>Starting at 11th level, your control deepens. You can now enter your transformation as a bonus action, and its duration extends to 30 minutes. While transformed, you regain hit points equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier at the start of your turn if you are below half your hit point maximum (minimum 1).</p>
      <p class="indent">You also gain a bonus to melee attack rolls made with Echo Strikes equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down).</p>

  <element name="Arcane Warding" type="Archetype Feature" source="Ramsay's Homebrew" id="ID_RAMSAY_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_ARCANE_WARDING">
    <description>
      <p>Beginning at 15th level, your magical defenses sharpen. You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects while transformed.</p>
      <p class="indent">Additionally, when you are within 5 feet of an ally and that ally is targeted by a spell attack, you can use your reaction to become the target instead.</p>
    </description>

  <element name="Arcane Mastery" type="Archetype Feature" source="Ramsay's Homebrew" id="ID_RAMSAY_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_ARCANE_MASTERY">
    <description>
      <p>At 18th level, your mastery over Ungeonic power reaches its peak. You can now use Arcane Metamorphosis three times between rests.</p>
      <p class="indent">Additionally, you gain the following Blood Curse:</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Blood Curse of the Unbound Glyph.</i></b> As an action, choose up to three creatures within 30 feet. Each must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or be restrained by glowing arcane sigils until the end of your next turn. Creatures that succeed are immune to this curse for 24 hours.</p>
      <p class="indent"><i>Amplify.</i> Increase the number of targets to five and the duration to 1 minute (concentration).</p>
