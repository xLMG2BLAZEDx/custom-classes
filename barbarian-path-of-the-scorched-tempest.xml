            <p>Barbarians who walk the Path of the Scorched Tempest are living conduits of chaotic magic. When they rage, they unleash violent pulses of elemental energy that scorch the battlefield. This is not controlled spellcasting—it is raw, magical detonation.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whether through exposure to a magical cataclysm or as the result of ancient experimentation, their rage burns with arcane heat. Those who fight near a Scorched Tempest risk being consumed by the elemental flares erupting from their body.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, when you enter a rage, a searing magical aura erupts around you. At the start of each of your turns while raging, each creature within 5 feet takes fire or lightning damage (your choice when you rage) equal to 1d4 + half your barbarian level.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, it also takes this damage unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier).</p>

            <description>When you rage, erupt with aura. Start of turn: 1d4 + half level fire or lightning damage to creatures within 5 ft. End of their turn: same damage unless CON save (DC = 8 + prof + CON).</description>

        <description>
            <p>At 6th level, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points while raging, magical energy flares outward. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or take damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) of the same type as your aura.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p>Starting at 10th level, your bond with raw magic sharpens your perception. While raging, you gain blindsight out to 10 feet and can see through magical darkness. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects while raging.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 14th level, you become a walking tempest. While raging, you can use your reaction when a creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you to unleash a violent arcane pulse. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 damage of your aura’s type and is pushed 10 feet away. On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not pushed.</p>

            <description>Reaction: when creature ends turn within 10 ft, force CON save (DC = 8 + prof + CON). Fail: 4d6 damage (aura type) + 10 ft push. Success: half damage, no push.</description>

            <p>At 17th level, your rage becomes a cataclysmic explosion of arcane power. Once per rage, as an action, you can unleash an Arcane Cataclysm centered on yourself. Each creature within 20 feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier).</p>
            <p class="indent">On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 damage of your aura’s type and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not blinded. This damage bypasses resistance to fire or lightning.</p>
