            <p>In the infinite halls of the Ungeon, where knowledge carves reality and shadows whisper truths, dwells an ancient being of thought incarnate: Ravyn, the Boundless One. A deity of insight and memory, Ravyn preserves the secrets of forgotten empires and the blueprints of stars. To enter a pact with this spectral archivist is to swear fealty to the written word, the mystery of the labyrinthine, and the boundless possibility of understanding.</p>
            <p class="indent">Those chosen by Ravyn are warped by cryptic wisdom. Their magic takes on the form of radiant glyphs and shimmering illusions, with spells that reshape perception and pull truth from veils. They are guardians of arcane memory and sentinels of the Ungeon’s halls.</p>
