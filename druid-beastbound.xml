			<p>Druids of the Circle of the Beastbound form mystical bonds with the beasts of the world, protecting and growing alongside their companions. These druids act as guardians of natural harmony through connection rather than transformation.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 2nd level when you choose this circle, you form a mystical bond with a beast companion. Choose a beast with a CR of 1/2 or lower that is not a swarm and has no flying or swimming speed. The beast is friendly to you and obeys your commands.</p>
			<p class="indent">You add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit points of a beast of its kind or four times your druid level, whichever is higher.</p>
			<p class="indent">The beast acts on your initiative. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use your bonus action to command it to take another action. If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own to protect you.</p>

			<p>Also at 2nd level, you can communicate telepathically with your beast companion while you are within 100 feet of each other. As a bonus action, you can command it to Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or make an Attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, your beast companion gains a special reaction. When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from it, your beast can use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the provoking creature’s next attack roll.</p>

			<p>Beginning at 6th level, your beast companion’s attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when your beast hits a creature with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to have the target make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, the target is knocked prone or pushed 10 feet away (your choice).</p>

			<p>At 14th level, your beast companion becomes a spiritual extension of your will. As a bonus action, you can merge your essence with it for 1 minute. While merged, you and the beast share hit points and resist all damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">During this time, you can cast spells through your beast as if it were the point of origin, and your companion’s attacks deal an extra 1d8 force damage. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
