            <p class="flavor">When a mortal bloodline is tainted with the essence of a powerful demon—whether through a pact, inheritance, or infernal experimentation—the result may be a Half-Demon. Agile, powerful, and often wrestling with their inner nature, Half-Demons walk the line between destruction and redemption.</p>
            <h4>HALF-DEMON TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Half-Demons share certain traits due to their demonic nature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity or Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma increases by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Type.</em></strong> You are a Fiend in addition to your original type.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Demonic Resilience.</em></strong> You have resistance to fire damage and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage while below half your hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Demonic Surge.</em></strong> Once per short rest, you can activate your demonic power for 1 minute as a bonus action. You gain temporary hit points equal to your level, +10 feet movement speed, unarmed strikes deal 1d6 + modifier force damage, and you can make one additional weapon or unarmed attack as a bonus action. At 11th level, these attacks count as magical.</p>
